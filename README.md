## Problem Statement :
Analyze sentiments in healthcare reviews.
This project aims to analyze sentiments in healthcare reviews. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we seek to classify reviews into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). This classification will provide insights into patient satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in healthcare services.

## Tasks to be performed : 
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Sentiment Analysis Model
3. Model Evaluation
4. Insights & Visualization

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models.
- `results/`: Directory for storing evaluation results and plots.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies needed to run the project.

## Data

The dataset contains healthcare reviews with the following features:

- Review text
- Sentiment label (e.g., positive, negative, neutral)
- Review date
- Reviewer demographics (optional)
- Healthcare provider information (optional)

## Setup
 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd healthcare-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for modeling:
```bash
python src/preprocess_data.py
```

### Model Training

Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate the trained models and generate performance metrics:
```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py
```
## Conclusion
In this project, we explored sentiment analysis on healthcare reviews using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The primary objective was to classify reviews into different sentiment categories (positive, negative, and neutral) to gain insights into patient satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in healthcare services.
